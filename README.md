# Auction Website Project

## Goal

The objective of this project is to utilize the skills learned over the past three semesters to create a fully functional auction website. This website will allow users to add items for auction and bid on items listed by other users.

## Brief

An auction site aims to launch a platform where:

- Users can register, add items for auction, and place bids on other users' items.
- New users receive 1000 credits upon registration to use on the site. Credits can be earned by selling items and used by buying items.
- Non-registered users can browse through the listings but only registered users can place bids.

**Note:** This project focuses on the front-end application that interacts with an existing API.

## API

The backend functionality is managed by an existing application. The API details for this project can be found under Auction Endpoints in the Noroff API documentation.
