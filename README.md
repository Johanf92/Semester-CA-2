# Auction Website Project

## Goal

The objective of this project is to utilize the skills learned over the past three semesters to create a fully functional auction website. This website will allow users to add items for auction and bid on items listed by other users.

## Brief

An auction site aims to launch a platform where:

- Users can register, add items for auction, and place bids on other users' items.
- New users receive 1000 credits upon registration to use on the site.
- Non-registered users can browse through the listings but only registered users can place bids.

## Resources

- **API Documentation**: [Auction Endpoints in Noroff API documentation](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/auction-house/listings)
